Hello and pardon the dust. I wasn’t expecting anyone to stumble onto this blog so soon. As famously said by [Some Other Dude at Google I/0, 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ):

>“Can you guys make it possible to create open source projects that start out hidden to the world, then get ‘revealed’ when they’re ready?”

Hopefully there will be more to come!
