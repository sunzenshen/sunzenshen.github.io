I recently had an opportunity to present a condensed version of my perspective on the OWASP API Security Top 10 at the [Wallarm API Security Summit in Denver](https://web.archive.org/web/20240815191528/https://www.wallarm.com/2024-api-and-application-security-summit-in-denver).
If you had the chance to attend that talk, thank you for your interest in my humble version of the topic materials. It really means a lot for interest to be present for local talks on the subject, even if there are really great free online training materials elsewhere.

I have a full version of the talk slides, which include additional content and demos that I cut for the lightning 30 minute version of the talk:

There is also a rehearsal recording for the full talk:

With the condensed version of the talk, I experimented with making the slides less text reliant, in order to add flexibility for timing.  If you would prefer to see that edit of the talk, you can find the slides for the condensed talk here:

As usual, I still highly recommend Cory Ball's online courses at [API Sec University](https://www.apisecuniversity.com/), but as other people have pointed out, I am available locally or online if you have any questions about the topic.

P.S. For the SnowFROC 2025 version of this talk, I added more refinements to the slides here:
