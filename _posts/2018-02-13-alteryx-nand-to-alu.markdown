title: Building an Arithmetic Logic Unit in Alteryx
categories: [Announcments]
tags: [Hardware, Simulation, NAND]
description: Missed the Minecraft rush, was stymied by supply bottlenecks in Factorio, and my Dwarf Fortress collapsed into a pile of rubble. Treading new ground in the sport of "why did you build a CPU there???" was elusive...

In 2017, I got quite engrossed in various circuit design games such as [MHRD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/MHRD/) and [Silicon Zeroes](https://pleasingfungus.itch.io/silicon-zeroes).
One thing led to another, and I ended up creating an Arithmetic Logic Unit emulation in [Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/),
a data analytics platform that I spend a lot of time with due to work. ;)
While this project started off as an elaborate practical joke to surprise colleagues,
I learned a lot adapting the [NAND 2 Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) material to an unusual environment.

Here, I'll update this post with the links to the blog series that I wrote about the whole process, as they are released on the planned cadence:
